# Raw Dictionary word lists

This directory contains the raw dictionaries used.  They are compiled into simple word lists with the following command:

`npm run build-dictionaries`

Note: The dictionaries are being moved to [cspell-dicts: Various cspell dictionaries](https://github.com/Jason3S/cspell-dicts)
